  - Tools:
    - `Impacket`
    - `MSF`
    - `Mimikatz`

- [ ] Group Policy Analysis
  - Identify misconfigured & vulnerable Group Policies that could lead to
    privesc or access ctrl issues.
  - Tools:
    - `BloodHound`
    - `Grouper2`

- [ ] ACL (Access Control List) Assessment
  - Analyze permissions and access controls to identify misconfigurations and
    potential vulnerabilities.
  - Tools:
    - `Aclpwn`
    - `BloodHound`
    - `Nmap`

- [ ] Domain Trust Exploitation
  - Identify & exploit trust relationships b/t domains to gain access.
  - Tools:
    - `BloodHound`
    - `MSF`
    - `PowerView`

- [ ] Domain Persistence Testing
  - Test the resilence of the AD environment against post-exploit techniques.
  - Tools:
    - `Covenant`
    - `CrackmapExec`
    - `PowerShell Empire`

- [ ] Privilege Escalation
  - Identify & exploit misconfigurations/vulns to elevate privileges.
  - Tools:

  - Move laterally w/in the network by compromising add'l systems.
  - Tools:
    - `BloodHound`
    - `Covenant`
    - `PowerShell Empire`

- [ ] Rogue DHCP Server Detection
  - Identify unauthorized DHCP servers that can lead to domain hijacking or
    MiTM attacks.
  - Tools:
    - `DHCPloc`
    - `Wireshark`

- [ ] AD Replication Analysis
  - Analyze replication logs to ensure the integrity and consistency of AD
    replication.
  - Tools:
    - `Repadmin`
    - `Replication Analyzer`
